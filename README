Project 0

This project goes through file and pulls all the strings into a ternary tree by the last letter of the word. Words which
share the same last letter go down the middle node. To run the program use the following command:

./P0 [file]

File is an optional command. If you don't provide a file (which has the presumed extension ".sp2022"), then the program
will read in from standard input - whether you are typing or it is reading indirectly from a supplied file. If you don't
provide a file, the output will be in three files with the name "output" followed by three suffixes.

To build the project, run the following command:

make

To clean the project, which I would recommend between each round, run the following command:

make clean
